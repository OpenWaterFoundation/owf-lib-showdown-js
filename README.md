# Getting Started

A standard development folder structure is recommended. The website development files can be set up as follows (Windows is assumed, but Linux would be similar):

```
> C:
> cd \Users\user
> mkdir showdown-js
> cd showdown-js
> mkdir git-repos
> cd git-repos
> git clone https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-lib-showdown-js
```
# Additional Documentation
Showdown is a JavaScript Markdown to HTML converter, based on the original works by John Gruber. Showdown can be used client side (in the browser) or server side (with NodeJs).
