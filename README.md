|**[Markdown-to-HTML-Simple-Editor](Markdown-to-HTML-Simple-Editor)**| This tutorial creates a simple  interactive browser Markdown editor using Showdown. This editor takes Markdown source code from the HTML file specifically, puts the Markdown souce code in the editor, and converts to HTML.             |
|**[Markdown-to-HTML-Fullpage-Story](Markdown-to-HTML-Fullpage-Story)**|  This demonstration integrates Showdown with fullpage stories. Separate Markdown files with content are used as the input files to convert to HTML. This significantly cuts back on the previously existing HTML source code.           | 

# Getting Started

A standard development folder structure is recommended. The website development files can be set up as follows (Windows is assumed, but Linux would be similar):

```
> C:
> cd \Users\user
> mkdir showdown-js
> cd showdown-js
> mkdir git-repos
> cd git-repos
> git clone https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-lib-showdown-js
```
# Additional Documentation
Showdown is a JavaScript Markdown to HTML converter, based on the original works by John Gruber. Showdown can be used client side (in the browser) or server side (with NodeJs).
