              <!-- <h2>Hydrology Concepts - The Hydrologic Cycle</h2>			  
			  <p>Hydrology is the study of water.</p>
			  <p>As a science, hydrology has evolved in response to the need to understand Earth's complex water systems and help solve water problems.  
			  The supply of water available for human use is limited by nature.  Although there is plenty of water on Earth, it is not always in the right 
			  place at the right time and of the right quality.</p>
			  <p>Hydrology encompasses the occurrence, distribution, movement and properties of water and its relationship with the environment within 
			  each phase of the hydrologic cycle, shown at right.  The hydrologic cycle, or water cycle, is a continuous process by which water is purified 
			  by evaporation and transported from the Earth's surface (including the oceans) into the atmosphere and back to the land and oceans.  All of 
			  the physical, chemical and biological processes involving water as it travels its various paths in the atmosphere (e.g., condensation and 
			  precipitation), over and beneath the Earth's surface (e.g., infiltration and snowmelt runoff) and through growing plants (e.g., transpiration) 
			  are studied.</p>
			  <p>There are many pathways water may take in its continuous cycle of falling as rainfall or snowfall and returning to the atmosphere. Water may 
			  be captured for millions of years in polar ice caps. It may flow to rivers and finally to the sea. It may soak into the soil to be evaporated 
			  directly from the soil surface as it dries or be transpired by growing plants. It may percolate through the soil to ground water reservoirs 
			  (aquifers) to be stored or it may flow to wells or springs or back to streams by seepage. The cycle for water may be short or it may take millions 
			  of years.</p> -->

              <!-- <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Hydrographs</h2>
			  <p>Hydrographs summarize river flows over a period of time, using a “time series” of data.  A time series is a time-ordered sequence of dates 
			  (possibly also with time of day) with corresponding data values.  Hydrographs provide a way to understand variation, trends and relationships 
			  in water data.  Other data types can be similarly graphed, but the word “hydrograph” is typically used when presenting water depth, flow and/or 
			  volume over time.</p>
			  <p>In Colorado, average annual statewide precipitation is 16 inches, with most regions receiving 12-16 inches.  The mountainous areas of the state 
			  receive more water.  Most areas above 10,000 feet in elevation receive 25 inches or more annually, mostly in the form of snow.  The snowpack typically 
			  builds up in the early spring from storms originating in the Pacific Ocean that move eastward.  The snowpack begins to melt in April and feeds 
			  into the State’s rivers.  Peak runoff from snowmelt occurs in May and June.  According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), 
			  approximately 80% of river runoff comes from snowmelt.  The remainder comes from rainfall and infiltration from groundwater 
			  (<a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" 
			  target="_blank">Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.4-6).</p>
			  <p>Understanding snowmelt amount and timing is critical to water resources planning.  The amount of snow and rain that feeds into rivers varies 
			  within a single year and also from year to year.  Hydrographs show the rate of flow (discharge) versus time past a specific point in a river, 
			  typically a streamgage (discussed in a later section).  The rate of flow is typically expressed in cubic feet per second (cfs).</p>  
			  <p>This interactive visualization shows five annual hydrographs from a streamgage on Boulder Creek.  Each line represents a year of flow data and 
			  shows the variability that can occur from year to year.  To select/deselect years on the plot, click on the year in the legend at the bottom.  
			  Note that even though these years represent a wide range of flows observed on Boulder Creek at this location, flows are most variable from 
			  mid-April to August.  (Source:  <a href="https://dnrweb.state.co.us/cdss/" target="_blank">CDSS HydroBase<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" 
			  width="12px"/></a>)</p>
			  <p>The year classifications (e.g., "Much Below Normal") are based on USGS terminology and are categorized as follows:</p>

			    <li><span style="color:#b30000;">Less than 10<sup>th</sup> percentile = Much Below Normal</span></li>

			  <p>Hydrologic variability occurs across space and time.  Within the South Platte Basin, flows can vary between sub-basins within the same 
			  year, with one sub-basin experiencing drought and another experiencing adequate water supplies.  Variation can occur because of elevation, 
			  regional weather patterns, water storage projects, impacts of specific storm events and other reasons.</p>  
			  <p>This interactive visualization shows annual flow volume in acre-feet from 1950 to 2011 for 32 streamgages in the basin, representing the South Platte River and

			  src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, Natural Flow time series).  Streamgages on the South Platte River are ordered 
			  from upstream to downstream and tributaries are generally arranged in order from where their confluences are with the South Platte River.  
			  Within a streamgage, average volumes are ranked and placed into percentile categories as follows:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li><span style="color:#b30000;">Less than 10<sup>th</sup> percentile = Much Below Normal</span></li>

			  </ul>
			  <p>Click on the categories within the legend to select/deselect the categories of flow conditions.  Note that 2002 was a severe drought across 
			  the entire basin and resulted in many changes, including the adoption of water conservation practices.  See the <a href="#drought">Drought</a> 
			  section for more information.</p>
			  <p>It is important to recognize that the data used in an analysis can be impacted by human actions.  Streamgage measurements reflect the 
			  impacts of diversions, reservoir releases and other impacts.  Therefore, evaluating streamgage data also indirectly reflects other conditions 
			  in the basin.  Annual data can also be impacted by extreme events.  For example, a streamgage may indicate drought conditions for the majority 
			  of the year and one large rain event may skew the annual result (e.g., the September 2013 flood event centered on the Colorado Front 
			  Range).  It may be necessary to view data at finer detail, such as a monthly interval, to fully understand conditions.  Fully understanding 
			  drought conditions requires evaluation of <a href="#storagesnowpack">snowpack</a>, precipitation, <a href="#naturalflows">natural flows</a>,

              <!-- <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Watersheds</h2>
			  <p>A watershed is an area of land that drains all the streams and rainfall to a common outlet, such as the outflow of a reservoir or any point 
			  along a stream channel. A watershed can also be referred to as a drainage basin or catchment; it is also possible to think of a watershed as a 
			  precipitation collector.  Ridges and hills that separate two watersheds are called the drainage divide.  In Colorado, the Continental Divide is 
			  an example of a drainage divide at the largest scale.  Water that falls west of the Divide will eventually make its way to the Pacific Ocean 
			  via rivers like the Colorado River.  Water that falls east of the Divide will eventually make its way to the Atlantic Ocean via rivers like the 
			  South Platte and Arkansas.  Natural drainage features may be modified by human impacts such as dams, tunnels, pumping, canals and other 
			  infrastructure.</p>
			  <p>A watershed consists of surface water--lakes, streams, reservoirs and wetlands--and all the underlying groundwater. Larger watersheds consist of 
			  many smaller watersheds. The size of the watershed depends on the outflow point:  all of the land that drains water to the outflow point is the watershed for 
			  that outflow point (<a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watershed.html" target="_blank">USGS Water Science School<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" 
			  width="12px"/></a>).  It is helpful to locate streamgages at the outflow point of important water supply watersheds or stream confluences.</p>
			  <p>There are a number of watershed datasets.  A common one is the 
			  <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/watershed-boundary-dataset?qt-science_support_page_related_con=4#qt-science_support_page_related_con" 
			  target="_blank">Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> from the U.S. Geological Survey, 
			  which is a nationwide dataset.  Here, watersheds are called hydrologic units and form a standardized system for organizing, collecting, managing 
			  and reporting hydrologic information. Hydrologic units are arranged in a nested, hierarchical system with each unit in the system identified using 
			  a unique code.  Hydrologic unit codes (HUC) are developed using a progressive two-digit system where each successively smaller areal unit is 
			  identified by adding two digits to the identifying code of the parent basin.  An example of this hierarchy is shown below.</p>
			  <p><img class="image-centered" src="images/huc-hierarchy.png" frameborder="0"></img></p>
			  <p>Source: <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/watershed-boundary-dataset?qt-science_support_page_related_con=4#qt-science_support_page_related_con" 
			  target="_blank">Watershed Boundary Dataset<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a></p> 
			  <p>The WBD contains eight levels of progressive hydrologic units identified by unique 2- to 16-digit codes. The dataset is complete for the United 
			  States to the 12-digit hydrologic unit.  The map at right shows HUC10 watersheds in the South Platte Basin.</p>
			  <p>The State of Colorado classifies watersheds into divisions (the South Platte Basin is Division 01) and districts, which correspond to 
			  basins associated with water administration.  Water-related data in the State's HydroBase database, such as diversion records and water rights, are 
			  assigned a "Water District Identifier" or WDID; the first two digits of the WDID are the water district number and the remaining digits indicate a 
			  structure such as a diversion headgate or reservoir.  On the map at right, click on the second Layers icon in the upper left 
			  corner to toggle to a map of the water districts in the Basin.  Note that the Republican River and Laramie River basins are sometimes considered 
			  with the South Platte Basin but that each has unique water resources issues.</p> -->

			  <p>Streams are the surface water conveyance features within a watershed.  There are a number of stream datasets, including:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li><a href="https://nhd.usgs.gov/NHD_High_Resolution.html" target="_blank">National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" 
			  width="12px"/></a> - from the U.S. Geological Survey.</li>
			    <li>Source Water Route Framework (SWRF) - developed by the Division of Water Resources and derived from the NHD.  The SWRF represents 
				most streams in Colorado, in particular those with water rights or other important features.  However, SWRF may not include minor streams 
				or features that do not have a nexus with water administration.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/clean-water-gis-maps" target="_blank">Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's 
				water quality stream segmentation<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> dataset - classifies stream segments based 
			    on level of impairment and the reasons for impairment (E. coli, sediment, temperature, etc.).</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p>Similar to NHD, the SWRF uses a Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) ID, an 8-digit identifier used to uniquely identify most streams in the 
			  state, rather than using the stream's common name (there are 13 streams named Dry Creek in the South Platte basin alone).  SWRF provides

			  <p>In order to manage the water resources of Colorado it is necessary to measure the surface water flow in natural streams and water distribution 
			  infrastructure.  Streamflow, also called discharge, in Colorado is measured by the <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/sw" 
			  target="_blank">U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>,

			  Water Resources (DWR)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, local water utilities and other entities that need to know flow amounts for reporting and operations.  Sensors and 
			  data loggers (also called data collection units (DCUs) or stage discharge recorders (SDRs)) may record measurements at regular intervals and can be 
			  triggered by changing values such as a rain event.  These measurements, often referred to as real-time or instantaneous, may or may not be publicly 
			  available.  Real-time data are often publicly reported at 15-minute intervals, representing average conditions over that time.  These values are then aggregated to 
			  longer intervals including hour and day.  Average values are often suitable for water supply management operations, whereas instantaneous values 
			  may be used to monitor peak flows, environmental flows or other critical conditions.</p>  
			  <p>It is important to recognize that a daily average flow, such as reported by USGS or DWR, does not mean that the flow was the same from midnight 
			  to midnight; in actuality, the flow could have varied significantly during the day and using shorter-interval data is necessary to understand the 
			  variation.</p>  
			  <p>Each organization that collects data assigns a station identifier and name to the station.  Multiple data sources, identifier conventions and 
			  data formats can present challenges to finding and using data.</p>

              <!-- <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Diversion Headgates and Measuring Diversions</h2>			  
			  <p>To divert water from a river into a ditch or canal, diversion structures are installed in the river.  Structures divert water for several reasons: 
			  to directly deliver water to agricultural land, to carry water to other ditches, to divert water into a storage reservoir or to deliver water for 
			  other purposes such as for municipal use.  Structures can be in the form of dams, pumps and headgates.  Headgates are typically metal gates that are 
			  raised and lowered to allow a controlled amount of water to flow into a ditch or canal.  The amount diverted depends on the water needed at that time 
			  and location, adherence to Colorado water law priority system and river conditions.  Water may not be physically available if the river flow is low 
			  and may not be taken if flows are extremely high and may damage infrastructure.  Diversion structures are identified using a Water District 
			  Identifier (WDID), consisting of a two-digit water district identifier and five-digit structure identifier.  Each diversion structure has one or more 
			  water rights that indicate seniority, use type and amount.</p>
			  <p>Measurement of diversions occurs in various ways.  Larger diversion structures may include a measurement structure such as a weir which, in 
			  combination with a water level sensor and rating, convert water level (stage) to flow (discharge); this provides a reasonable estimate of the diversion 
			  amount.  Many large diversion structures now have telemetered automated data measurement.  Similar to streamflow, diversion measurements may be available
			  as real-time data (15-minute or hourly) or as longer intervals that are typically used for historical data analysis.  The accuracy of diversion 
			  measurement will depend on the measurement device design and calibration and can be impacted by sediment, flow impediments such as tree trunks, 
			  technology issues and degradation of the infrastructure, such as settling, cracking and vegetation growth.  <a href="http://www.dwr.state.co.us/SurfaceWater/data/division.aspx?div=1"

			  also note these are just ditch diversions and not diversions for other structure types, such as wells).  Structures are color-coded based on water source:  
			  the 10 streams with the most diversions are colored and listed in order (i.e., the South Platte River has the most ditch diversions, followed by the Cache

			  <p>Groundwater is water that is held underground within aquifers, which are geological formations (essentially rock or soil layers).  The water is 
			  contained within tiny pore spaces or cracks in the solid material.  There are three types of aquifers:  alluvial, sedimentary bedrock and fractured rock.  
			  Alluvial aquifers are generally composed of shallow sand and gravel deposits.  They are often also called tributary aquifers because they exchange 
			  water with surface streams.  Groundwater in alluvial aquifers is recharged by the infiltration of rain and snowmelt through the soil.  Seepage from 
			  irrigation canals and reservoirs and inflows from nearby aquifers also contribute water.  The South Platte Alluvial Aquifer is one of the largest 
			  and most utilized alluvial aquifers in Colorado (<a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" 
			  target="_blank">Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.15-16).</p>
			  <p>Sedimentary bedrock aquifers occur deep underground primarily in sandstone and limestone.  These types of aquifers are not often hydraulically 
			  connected to nearby streams.  They still have recharge areas like alluvial aquifers, but these may be many miles from the actual aquifer.  Deep 
			  aquifers require long periods of time to recharge – potentially thousands of years.  The Denver Basin aquifer system is an example of a sedimentary bedrock aquifer
			  (Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From, p.17).</p>
			  <p>Fractured rock aquifers occur in bedrock that contains cracks and fractures due to the folding and faulting of the rock over millions of years.  
			  These types of aquifers are common in mountainous areas.  Springs occur where fractures in the rock intersect the surface (Citizen's Guide to Where 
			  Your Water Comes From, p.19).</p>
			  <p>The <a href="https://gis.colorado.gov/dnrviewer/Index.html?viewer=mapviewer" target="_blank">CDSS Map Viewer<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" 
			  width="12px"/></a> contains spatial data layers of alluvial and bedrock aquifers.  To view these, click on the Geology layer, then click on the dropdown 
			  menu to click on the Alluvial Aquifer and Bedrock Aquifer sub-layers.</p>
			  <p>Groundwater is used for city water supplies, industry, irrigation, rural domestic use and livestock watering.  The State Engineer has estimated 
			  that about 2 million acre-feet of groundwater is pumped and used annually, which amounts to approximately 20% of all water used in Colorado 
			  (Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From, p.29).</p>
			  <p>Groundwater from aquifers is made accessible to users via wells.  Groundwater use is administered and enforced by the <a href="http://water.state.co.us/groundwater/Pages/default.aspx" 
			  target="_blank">Division of Water Resources<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>.  This tool, from <a href="http://cdss.state.co.us/Pages/CDSSHome.aspx" 
			  target="_blank">Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>shows that there 
			  are over 13,000 wells in the South Platte Basin alone.  (Click on the Map tab to see locations in the Basin).  Wells are numerous because they 
			  allow easy access to water.  Wells are often drilled in locations that are convenient to farms and homes, whereas surface water may be located much 
			  farther away.</p>
			  <p>Small wells, such as domestic wells, are constructed after obtaining a well permit and have limited size (50 gallons per minute or less).  Larger 
			  wells, such as used for agriculture and municipal supply, have a water right decree and typically have a Water District Identifier (WDID) similar to 
			  headgates, with similar <a href="https://dnrweb.state.co.us/cdss/Structures?submitButton=Submit&SelectedGeoValue=waterDivisionDiv&SelectedWaterDivisionId=1&SelectedStructureId=2"

			  <p>It may seem as though water is continuously removed from streams for agricultural, municipal and other uses and therefore the amount of water 
			  in a stream decreases as one moves downstream.  However, water that is diverted for municipal, industrial or agricultural purposes that is not 
			  consumed returns to rivers and/or aquifers by surface flows or underground flows.  For example, the U.S. Geological Survey has estimated that 
			  approximately only 37% of the water diverted statewide for agriculture is actually consumed 
			  (<a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" 
			  target="_blank">Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.12).</p>
			  <p>These surface and underground flows are collectively called return flows and can be used by downstream water users.  Types of return flows 
			  include runoff and infiltration from agricultural lands, runoff and infiltration from lawns and landscaping and returns from wastewater treatment 
			  plants or industry.  Irrigation return flows, in particular, are often reused multiple times. Unless a municipality relies exclusively on groundwater 
			  or its water supply comes directly from a river’s headwaters, its supply includes reused water.  The term “direct reuse” indicates wastewater 
			  that is directly used for municipal supply and “indirect reuse” indicates mixing wastewater with other supplies.  Many cities in Colorado rely 
			  on reused (or recycled) water (Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From, p.24; 
			  <a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-colorado-water-conservation/" 
			  target="_blank">Citizen's Guide to Colorado Water Conservation<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.20-21).</p>
			  <p>Water that has been diverted from other basins (transbasin diversions) contributes flows to streams and can result in some streams actually 
			  being larger than natural conditions.</p>
			  <p>This <a href="http://water.state.co.us/SurfaceWater/SWRights/WaterDiagrams/Pages/SnakeDiagram.aspx" target="_blank">diagram<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" 
			  width="12px"/></a>, sometimes called the "snake diagram", from DWR shows how flows greatly increase downstream of Denver, which allows reuse for 
			  agriculture and other purposes.  In general, municipalities seek cleaner water supplies, which often means acquiring mountain supplies.  In some 
			  cases, exchanges can occur, for example, allowing a municipality to use cleaner mountain water supplies in exchange for agricultural or other users 
			  taking water from municipal water rights downstream.  This allows different water providers in a region to share infrastructure and water supplies 
			  to optimize the system.</p>
			  <p>Notice how both the South Platte and Arkansas rivers do not gain large amounts of flow like rivers on the West Slope.  Rather, these rivers' widths 
			  are narrower and a more consistent width along their lengths.  This is an indication that the basins rely on return flows and reuse to utilize 
			  lower basin supplies to meet multiple needs.</p>

			  CWCB report include the following (p.1-4):</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">All climate model projections indicate future warming in Colorado. The statewide average annual temperatures are projected to warm by +2.5&#8457 
				to +5&#8457 by 2050 relative to a 1971–2000 baseline under a medium-low greenhouse-gas emissions scenario.  Under a high emissions scenario, the 
				projected warming is larger at mid-century (+3.5&#8457 to +6.5&#8457).</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">No long-term trends in average annual precipitation have been detected across Colorado, even considering the relatively dry period since 2000.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Climate model projections show less agreement regarding future precipitation change for Colorado.  The individual model projections of change 
				by 2050 in statewide annual precipitation range from -5% to +6% for one model and from -3% to +8% for another model.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">Snowpack, as measured by April 1 snow-water equivalent (SWE), has been mainly below-average since 2000 in all of Colorado’s river basins, 
				but no long-term (30-year, 50-year) declining trends have been detected.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Most model projections of Colorado’s spring snowpack show declines for the mid-21st century due to the projected warming.</li>				
				<li style="text-align:left;">The timing of snowmelt and peak runoff has shifted earlier in the spring by 1–4 weeks across Colorado’s river basins over the past 30 
				years, due to the combination of lower SWE since 2000, the warming trend in spring temperatures and enhanced solar absorption from dust-on-snow.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">The peak of the spring runoff is projected to shift 1–3 weeks earlier by the mid-21st century due to warming. Late-summer flows are 
				projected to decrease as the peak shifts earlier. Changes in the timing of runoff are more certain than changes in the amount of runoff.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">No long-term statewide trends in heavy precipitation events have been detected. The evidence suggests that there has been no statewide 
				trend in the magnitude of flood events, although climate change is expected to result in more intense storms.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">Nearly all of the model projections indicate increasing winter precipitation by 2050. There is weaker consensus among the projections 
				regarding precipitation in the other seasons.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">In the first projections of future Colorado hydrology based on the latest climate model output, most projections show decreases in 
				annual streamflow by 2050 for the San Juan and Rio Grande basins. The projections are more evenly split between future increases and decreases 
				in streamflow by 2050 for the Colorado Headwaters, Gunnison, Arkansas and South Platte basins. However, other hydrology projections show drier 
				outcomes for Colorado, and the <i>overall body of published research indicates a tendency towards future decreases in annual streamflow for all of 
				Colorado’s river basins</i>.</li>

			  <p>Increasing temperatures will have a significant impact on outdoor water use, irrigated agriculture, and natural vegetation water use, with some estimates of up 
				to 25% more demand, based on higher temperatures and a longer growing season (<b>need citation</b>).</p>
			  <p>It is difficult to fully quantify the impacts of climate change on water resources.  Systems models such as StateMod have been used to simulate river systems 
			  using a possible range of precipitation, temperature and related data, in order to understand impacts on water supplies (see the

			  width="12px"/></a>).  A general concern among municipal water providers is that the gains due to water conservation will be offset by the impacts of climate change 
			  and efforts to develop new water supplies must account not only for certain population growth but uncertain, yet significant, impacts of climate change.</p>			   -->

			  <p style="text-align:left;">This story is designed to provide information in one-page sections, each of which should fit within the web browser page.  To move forward 
			  or backward in the story, use the following options:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">Page Up and Page Down keys</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">Arrow Up and Arrow Down keys</li>				
				<li style="text-align:left;">Mouse scroll wheel - a slight turn will advance the page automatically</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Menu at the top of the story to navigate to major sections</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Click on the dots on the right side of the screen - hover over a dot to see the title of the page</li>
			  </ul>	
			  <p style="text-align:left;">Additional instructions for viewing the story include:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">The content is best viewed on a relatively large display and has not been optimized for mobile devices.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">If content does not seem to fit in the browser window, maximize the window size or use Ctrl - to reduce font sizes. 
				Ctrl + can be used to increase font sizes.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">For interactive maps, the default behavior for the mouse scroll is to advance the story page.  Click on the mouse 
				icon (<img src="images/mouse_white.png" width="16px"/>) in the map to change mouse scrolling to zoom behavior.  Once changed, 
				the behavior will apply only to the specific map.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Interactive maps can be repositioned by holding the left mouse button and dragging the map.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Scrollable text areas are provided in some pages and can be scrolled by dragging the text area scroll bar.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">External pages are indicated with a <img src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" width="12px"/> graphic and 
				will be shown in a separate tab when selected.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Links to sections within the story and external pages are generally the same font color as normal text but are 
				indicated with underlines.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Visualizations that will slow down the story are linked to as separate pages and will be shown in a different tab 
				when selected.  Mouse over the image to see a popup link to the separate page.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Interactive maps provide popups to view data.  If the popup flashes, drag the map to reposition it so that 
				the popup does not occur in the same area as the map instruction box.</li>			  
				<li style="text-align:left;">Some maps allow clicking on map markers to access links to additional data.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p style="text-align:left;">Interactive graphs typically behave as follows:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">Zoom into the graph either by holding the left mouse button and drawing a rectangle on the graph or by clicking/holding/dragging the buttons 
				on either end of the time slider in the overview graph below the main graph.</li>  
				<li style="text-align:left;">Once the time slider "window" (light blue shaded area in the overview graph) has been narrowed, use the mouse to drag the shaded area to another 
				time period.  Or, click in the overview graph on either side of the shaded area to center the graph period on the clicked point.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">To fully zoom out, drag the ends of the shaded area in the overview graph to the margins of the graph.</li>    
				<li style="text-align:left;">All time series can be selected or deselected by clicking on the "Select All Series" or "Deselect All Series" buttons below the graph.  It is 
				also possible to individually select or deselect one time series at a time by clicking on the time series name in the legend.</li>
