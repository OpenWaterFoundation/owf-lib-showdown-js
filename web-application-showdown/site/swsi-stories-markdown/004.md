Hydrology Concepts - Streams
=============
Streams are the surface water conveyance features within a watershed. There are a number of stream datasets, including:

- [National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con) - from the U.S. Geological Survey.
- Source Water Route Framework (SWRF) - developed by the Division of Water Resources and derived from the NHD. The SWRF represents most streams in Colorado, in particular those with water rights or other important features. However, SWRF may not include minor streams or features that do not have a nexus with water administration.
- [Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's water quality stream segmentation](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/clean-water-gis-maps) dataset - classifies stream segments based on level of impairment and the reasons for impairment (E. coli, sediment, temperature, etc.).
Similar to NHD, the SWRF uses a Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) ID, an 8-digit identifier used to uniquely identify most streams in the state, rather than using the stream's common name (there are 13 streams named Dry Creek in the South Platte basin alone). SWRF provides a more simple dataset than NHD: in the SWRF each line represents a stream or river, whereas NHD provides many individual line segments for each stream or river. It is important when using these datasets to indicate the version because government agencies do periodically adjust the data.

By using the NHD linked to the SWRF, it is possible to link federal and State datasets. Datasets such as stream gages, diversion structures and instream flow rights (discussed in subsequent pages in this story) can be "referenced" to the SWRF to provide a common framework for analysis; such data work is ongoing in order to leverage the SWRF dataset.

This map shows a small section of the SWRF, representing the southwest portion of the Basin. The SWRF layer shown here is cropped because showing the full basin would result in a slower visualization. The full SWRF can be downloaded [here](https://www.colorado.gov/cdss).
