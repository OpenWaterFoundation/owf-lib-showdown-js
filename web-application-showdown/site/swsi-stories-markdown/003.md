Hydrology Concepts - Watersheds
==============

A watershed is an area of land that drains all the streams and rainfall to a common outlet, such as the outflow of a reservoir or any point along a stream channel. A watershed can also be referred to as a drainage basin or catchment; it is also possible to think of a watershed as a precipitation collector. Ridges and hills that separate two watersheds are called the drainage divide. In Colorado, the Continental Divide is an example of a drainage divide at the largest scale. Water that falls west of the Divide will eventually make its way to the Pacific Ocean via rivers like the Colorado River. Water that falls east of the Divide will eventually make its way to the Atlantic Ocean via rivers like the South Platte and Arkansas. Natural drainage features may be modified by human impacts such as dams, tunnels, pumping, canals and other infrastructure.

A watershed consists of surface water--lakes, streams, reservoirs and wetlands--and all the underlying groundwater. Larger watersheds consist of many smaller watersheds. The size of the watershed depends on the outflow point: all of the land that drains water to the outflow point is the watershed for that outflow point ([USGS Water Science School](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/watersheds-and-drainage-basins?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)). It is helpful to locate streamgages at the outflow point of important water supply watersheds or stream confluences.

There are a number of watershed datasets. A common one is the [Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD)](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/watershed-boundary-dataset?qt-science_support_page_related_con=4#qt-science_support_page_related_con) from the U.S. Geological Survey, which is a nationwide dataset. Here, watersheds are called hydrologic units and form a standardized system for organizing, collecting, managing and reporting hydrologic information. Hydrologic units are arranged in a nested, hierarchical system with each unit in the system identified using a unique code. Hydrologic unit codes (HUC) are developed using a progressive two-digit system where each successively smaller areal unit is identified by adding two digits to the identifying code of the parent basin. An example of this hierarchy is shown below.

The WBD contains eight levels of progressive hydrologic units identified by unique 2- to 16-digit codes. The dataset is complete for the United States to the 12-digit hydrologic unit. The map at right shows HUC10 watersheds in the South Platte Basin.

The State of Colorado classifies watersheds into divisions (the South Platte Basin is Division 01) and districts, which correspond to basins associated with water administration. Water-related data in the State's HydroBase database, such as diversion records and water rights, are assigned a "Water District Identifier" or WDID; the first two digits of the WDID are the water district number and the remaining digits indicate a structure such as a diversion headgate or reservoir. On the map at right, click on the second Layers icon in the upper left corner to toggle to a map of the water districts in the Basin. Note that the Republican River and Laramie River basins are sometimes considered with the South Platte Basin but that each has unique water resources issues.
