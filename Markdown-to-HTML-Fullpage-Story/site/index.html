			  <p>Hydrology is the study of water.</p>
			  <p>As a science, hydrology has evolved in response to the need to understand Earth's complex water systems and help solve water problems.  
			  The supply of water available for human use is limited by nature.  Although there is plenty of water on Earth, it is not always in the right 
			  place at the right time and of the right quality.</p>
			  <p>Hydrology encompasses the occurrence, distribution, movement and properties of water and its relationship with the environment within 
			  each phase of the hydrologic cycle, shown at right.  The hydrologic cycle, or water cycle, is a continuous process by which water is purified 
			  by evaporation and transported from the Earth's surface (including the oceans) into the atmosphere and back to the land and oceans.  All of 
			  the physical, chemical and biological processes involving water as it travels its various paths in the atmosphere (e.g., condensation and 
			  precipitation), over and beneath the Earth's surface (e.g., infiltration and snowmelt runoff) and through growing plants (e.g., transpiration) 
			  are studied.</p>
			  <p>There are many pathways water may take in its continuous cycle of falling as rainfall or snowfall and returning to the atmosphere. Water may 
			  be captured for millions of years in polar ice caps. It may flow to rivers and finally to the sea. It may soak into the soil to be evaporated 
			  directly from the soil surface as it dries or be transpired by growing plants. It may percolate through the soil to ground water reservoirs 
			  (aquifers) to be stored or it may flow to wells or springs or back to streams by seepage. The cycle for water may be short or it may take millions 
			  of years.</p> -->

              <!-- <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Hydrographs</h2>
			  <p>Hydrographs summarize river flows over a period of time, using a “time series” of data.  A time series is a time-ordered sequence of dates 
			  (possibly also with time of day) with corresponding data values.  Hydrographs provide a way to understand variation, trends and relationships 
			  in water data.  Other data types can be similarly graphed, but the word “hydrograph” is typically used when presenting water depth, flow and/or 
			  volume over time.</p>
			  <p>In Colorado, average annual statewide precipitation is 16 inches, with most regions receiving 12-16 inches.  The mountainous areas of the state 
			  receive more water.  Most areas above 10,000 feet in elevation receive 25 inches or more annually, mostly in the form of snow.  The snowpack typically 
			  builds up in the early spring from storms originating in the Pacific Ocean that move eastward.  The snowpack begins to melt in April and feeds 
			  into the State’s rivers.  Peak runoff from snowmelt occurs in May and June.  According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), 
			  approximately 80% of river runoff comes from snowmelt.  The remainder comes from rainfall and infiltration from groundwater 
			  (<a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" 
			  target="_blank">Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.4-6).</p>
			  <p>Understanding snowmelt amount and timing is critical to water resources planning.  The amount of snow and rain that feeds into rivers varies 
			  within a single year and also from year to year.  Hydrographs show the rate of flow (discharge) versus time past a specific point in a river, 
			  typically a streamgage (discussed in a later section).  The rate of flow is typically expressed in cubic feet per second (cfs).</p>  
			  <p>This interactive visualization shows five annual hydrographs from a streamgage on Boulder Creek.  Each line represents a year of flow data and 
			  shows the variability that can occur from year to year.  To select/deselect years on the plot, click on the year in the legend at the bottom.  
			  Note that even though these years represent a wide range of flows observed on Boulder Creek at this location, flows are most variable from 
			  mid-April to August.  (Source:  <a href="https://dnrweb.state.co.us/cdss/" target="_blank">CDSS HydroBase<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" 
			  width="12px"/></a>)</p>
			  <p>The year classifications (e.g., "Much Below Normal") are based on USGS terminology and are categorized as follows:</p>

			  <p>Hydrologic variability occurs across space and time.  Within the South Platte Basin, flows can vary between sub-basins within the same 
			  year, with one sub-basin experiencing drought and another experiencing adequate water supplies.  Variation can occur because of elevation, 
			  regional weather patterns, water storage projects, impacts of specific storm events and other reasons.</p>  
			  <p>This interactive visualization shows annual flow volume in acre-feet from 1950 to 2011 for 32 streamgages in the basin, representing the South Platte River and

			  src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, Natural Flow time series).  Streamgages on the South Platte River are ordered 
			  from upstream to downstream and tributaries are generally arranged in order from where their confluences are with the South Platte River.  
			  Within a streamgage, average volumes are ranked and placed into percentile categories as follows:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li><span style="color:#b30000;">Less than 10<sup>th</sup> percentile = Much Below Normal</span></li>

			  </ul>
			  <p>Click on the categories within the legend to select/deselect the categories of flow conditions.  Note that 2002 was a severe drought across 
			  the entire basin and resulted in many changes, including the adoption of water conservation practices.  See the <a href="#drought">Drought</a> 
			  section for more information.</p>
			  <p>It is important to recognize that the data used in an analysis can be impacted by human actions.  Streamgage measurements reflect the 
			  impacts of diversions, reservoir releases and other impacts.  Therefore, evaluating streamgage data also indirectly reflects other conditions 
			  in the basin.  Annual data can also be impacted by extreme events.  For example, a streamgage may indicate drought conditions for the majority 
			  of the year and one large rain event may skew the annual result (e.g., the September 2013 flood event centered on the Colorado Front 
			  Range).  It may be necessary to view data at finer detail, such as a monthly interval, to fully understand conditions.  Fully understanding 
			  drought conditions requires evaluation of <a href="#storagesnowpack">snowpack</a>, precipitation, <a href="#naturalflows">natural flows</a>,

              <!-- <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Watersheds</h2>
			  <p>A watershed is an area of land that drains all the streams and rainfall to a common outlet, such as the outflow of a reservoir or any point 
			  along a stream channel. A watershed can also be referred to as a drainage basin or catchment; it is also possible to think of a watershed as a 
			  precipitation collector.  Ridges and hills that separate two watersheds are called the drainage divide.  In Colorado, the Continental Divide is 
			  an example of a drainage divide at the largest scale.  Water that falls west of the Divide will eventually make its way to the Pacific Ocean 
			  via rivers like the Colorado River.  Water that falls east of the Divide will eventually make its way to the Atlantic Ocean via rivers like the 
			  South Platte and Arkansas.  Natural drainage features may be modified by human impacts such as dams, tunnels, pumping, canals and other 
			  infrastructure.</p>
			  <p>A watershed consists of surface water--lakes, streams, reservoirs and wetlands--and all the underlying groundwater. Larger watersheds consist of 
			  many smaller watersheds. The size of the watershed depends on the outflow point:  all of the land that drains water to the outflow point is the watershed for 
			  that outflow point (<a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watershed.html" target="_blank">USGS Water Science School<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" 
			  width="12px"/></a>).  It is helpful to locate streamgages at the outflow point of important water supply watersheds or stream confluences.</p>
			  <p>There are a number of watershed datasets.  A common one is the 
			  <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/watershed-boundary-dataset?qt-science_support_page_related_con=4#qt-science_support_page_related_con" 
			  target="_blank">Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> from the U.S. Geological Survey, 
			  which is a nationwide dataset.  Here, watersheds are called hydrologic units and form a standardized system for organizing, collecting, managing 
			  and reporting hydrologic information. Hydrologic units are arranged in a nested, hierarchical system with each unit in the system identified using 
			  a unique code.  Hydrologic unit codes (HUC) are developed using a progressive two-digit system where each successively smaller areal unit is 
			  identified by adding two digits to the identifying code of the parent basin.  An example of this hierarchy is shown below.</p>
			  <p><img class="image-centered" src="images/huc-hierarchy.png" frameborder="0"></img></p>
			  <p>Source: <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/watershed-boundary-dataset?qt-science_support_page_related_con=4#qt-science_support_page_related_con" 
			  target="_blank">Watershed Boundary Dataset<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a></p> 
			  <p>The WBD contains eight levels of progressive hydrologic units identified by unique 2- to 16-digit codes. The dataset is complete for the United 
			  States to the 12-digit hydrologic unit.  The map at right shows HUC10 watersheds in the South Platte Basin.</p>
			  <p>The State of Colorado classifies watersheds into divisions (the South Platte Basin is Division 01) and districts, which correspond to 
			  basins associated with water administration.  Water-related data in the State's HydroBase database, such as diversion records and water rights, are 
			  assigned a "Water District Identifier" or WDID; the first two digits of the WDID are the water district number and the remaining digits indicate a 
			  structure such as a diversion headgate or reservoir.  On the map at right, click on the second Layers icon in the upper left 
			  corner to toggle to a map of the water districts in the Basin.  Note that the Republican River and Laramie River basins are sometimes considered 
			  with the South Platte Basin but that each has unique water resources issues.</p> -->

              <!-- <h2>Hydrology Concepts - Diversion Headgates and Measuring Diversions</h2>			  
			  <p>To divert water from a river into a ditch or canal, diversion structures are installed in the river.  Structures divert water for several reasons: 
			  to directly deliver water to agricultural land, to carry water to other ditches, to divert water into a storage reservoir or to deliver water for 
			  other purposes such as for municipal use.  Structures can be in the form of dams, pumps and headgates.  Headgates are typically metal gates that are 
			  raised and lowered to allow a controlled amount of water to flow into a ditch or canal.  The amount diverted depends on the water needed at that time 
			  and location, adherence to Colorado water law priority system and river conditions.  Water may not be physically available if the river flow is low 
			  and may not be taken if flows are extremely high and may damage infrastructure.  Diversion structures are identified using a Water District 
			  Identifier (WDID), consisting of a two-digit water district identifier and five-digit structure identifier.  Each diversion structure has one or more 
			  water rights that indicate seniority, use type and amount.</p>
			  <p>Measurement of diversions occurs in various ways.  Larger diversion structures may include a measurement structure such as a weir which, in 
			  combination with a water level sensor and rating, convert water level (stage) to flow (discharge); this provides a reasonable estimate of the diversion 
			  amount.  Many large diversion structures now have telemetered automated data measurement.  Similar to streamflow, diversion measurements may be available
			  as real-time data (15-minute or hourly) or as longer intervals that are typically used for historical data analysis.  The accuracy of diversion 
			  measurement will depend on the measurement device design and calibration and can be impacted by sediment, flow impediments such as tree trunks, 
			  technology issues and degradation of the infrastructure, such as settling, cracking and vegetation growth.  <a href="http://www.dwr.state.co.us/SurfaceWater/data/division.aspx?div=1"

			  <p>This map shows ditch diversion structures in the Basin, of which there are over 3,500 (note these include active, inactive and historical diversions; 
			  also note these are just ditch diversions and not diversions for other structure types, such as wells).  Structures are color-coded based on water source:  
			  the 10 streams with the most diversions are colored and listed in order (i.e., the South Platte River has the most ditch diversions, followed by the Cache 
			  la Poudre River); diversions from all other streams are shown in black.</p>
			  <p>The table below lists the number of ditch diversions on each stream in the Basin for those streams that have 10 or more ditch diversion structures.</p> -->

			  <!-- <p>In 2014, the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB) released a report titled <a href="http://wwa.colorado.edu/climate/co2014report/Climate_Change_CO_Report_2014_FINAL.pdf" 
			  target="_blank">"Climate Change in Colorado:  A Synthesis to Support Water Resources Management and Adaptation"<img src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>.  
			  This, along with the <a href="https://issuu.com/cfwe/docs/cfwe_cc_cg_web" target="_blank">Citizen's Guide to Colorado Climate Change<img 
			  src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> assess how climate change will affect Colorado's water resources.  Key points from the 
			  CWCB report include the following (p.1-4):</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">All climate model projections indicate future warming in Colorado. The statewide average annual temperatures are projected to warm by +2.5&#8457 
				to +5&#8457 by 2050 relative to a 1971–2000 baseline under a medium-low greenhouse-gas emissions scenario.  Under a high emissions scenario, the 
				projected warming is larger at mid-century (+3.5&#8457 to +6.5&#8457).</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">No long-term trends in average annual precipitation have been detected across Colorado, even considering the relatively dry period since 2000.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Climate model projections show less agreement regarding future precipitation change for Colorado.  The individual model projections of change 
				by 2050 in statewide annual precipitation range from -5% to +6% for one model and from -3% to +8% for another model.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">Snowpack, as measured by April 1 snow-water equivalent (SWE), has been mainly below-average since 2000 in all of Colorado’s river basins, 
				but no long-term (30-year, 50-year) declining trends have been detected.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Most model projections of Colorado’s spring snowpack show declines for the mid-21st century due to the projected warming.</li>				
				<li style="text-align:left;">The timing of snowmelt and peak runoff has shifted earlier in the spring by 1–4 weeks across Colorado’s river basins over the past 30 
				years, due to the combination of lower SWE since 2000, the warming trend in spring temperatures and enhanced solar absorption from dust-on-snow.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">The peak of the spring runoff is projected to shift 1–3 weeks earlier by the mid-21st century due to warming. Late-summer flows are 
				projected to decrease as the peak shifts earlier. Changes in the timing of runoff are more certain than changes in the amount of runoff.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">No long-term statewide trends in heavy precipitation events have been detected. The evidence suggests that there has been no statewide 
				trend in the magnitude of flood events, although climate change is expected to result in more intense storms.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">Nearly all of the model projections indicate increasing winter precipitation by 2050. There is weaker consensus among the projections 
				regarding precipitation in the other seasons.</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">In the first projections of future Colorado hydrology based on the latest climate model output, most projections show decreases in 
				annual streamflow by 2050 for the San Juan and Rio Grande basins. The projections are more evenly split between future increases and decreases 
				in streamflow by 2050 for the Colorado Headwaters, Gunnison, Arkansas and South Platte basins. However, other hydrology projections show drier 
				outcomes for Colorado, and the <i>overall body of published research indicates a tendency towards future decreases in annual streamflow for all of 
				Colorado’s river basins</i>.</li>				
			  </ul>
			  <p>Increasing temperatures will have a significant impact on outdoor water use, irrigated agriculture, and natural vegetation water use, with some estimates of up 
				to 25% more demand, based on higher temperatures and a longer growing season (<b>need citation</b>).</p>
			  <p>It is difficult to fully quantify the impacts of climate change on water resources.  Systems models such as StateMod have been used to simulate river systems 
			  using a possible range of precipitation, temperature and related data, in order to understand impacts on water supplies (see the 
			  <a href="http://cwcbweblink.state.co.us/WebLink/ElectronicFile.aspx?docid=158319&searchid=78f0eafa-0b8f-4d8a-9ff3-faf67cc82f52&dbid=0" target="_blank">Colorado 
			  River Water Availability Study<img src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> and the 
			  <a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/programs/crbstudy.html" target="_blank">Colorado River Water Supply and Demand Study<img src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" 
			  width="12px"/></a>).  A general concern among municipal water providers is that the gains due to water conservation will be offset by the impacts of climate change 
			  and efforts to develop new water supplies must account not only for certain population growth but uncertain, yet significant, impacts of climate change.</p>			   -->
