Hydrology Concepts - Groundwater and Measuring Water Level and Pumping
====================
Groundwater is water that is held underground within aquifers, which are geological formations (essentially rock or soil layers). The water is contained within tiny pore spaces or cracks in the solid material. There are three types of aquifers: alluvial, sedimentary bedrock and fractured rock. Alluvial aquifers are generally composed of shallow sand and gravel deposits. They are often also called tributary aquifers because they exchange water with surface streams. Groundwater in alluvial aquifers is recharged by the infiltration of rain and snowmelt through the soil. Seepage from irrigation canals and reservoirs and inflows from nearby aquifers also contribute water. The South Platte Alluvial Aquifer is one of the largest and most utilized alluvial aquifers in Colorado ( ([Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From](https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/publications-and-radio/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/), p.15-16).

Sedimentary bedrock aquifers occur deep underground primarily in sandstone and limestone. These types of aquifers are not often hydraulically connected to nearby streams. They still have recharge areas like alluvial aquifers, but these may be many miles from the actual aquifer. Deep aquifers require long periods of time to recharge â€“ potentially thousands of years. The Denver Basin aquifer system is an example of a sedimentary bedrock aquifer ([Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From](https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/publications-and-radio/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/), p.17).

Fractured rock aquifers occur in bedrock that contains cracks and fractures due to the folding and faulting of the rock over millions of years. These types of aquifers are common in mountainous areas. Springs occur where fractures in the rock intersect the surface (Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From, p.19).

The [CDSS Map Viewer](https://gis.colorado.gov/dnrviewer/Index.html?viewer=mapviewer) contains spatial data layers of alluvial and bedrock aquifers. To view these, click on the Geology layer, then click on the dropdown menu to click on the Alluvial Aquifer and Bedrock Aquifer sub-layers.

Groundwater is used for city water supplies, industry, irrigation, rural domestic use and livestock watering. The State Engineer has estimated that about 2 million acre-feet of groundwater is pumped and used annually, which amounts to approximately 20% of all water used in Colorado (Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From, p.29).

Groundwater from aquifers is made accessible to users via wells. Groundwater use is administered and enforced by the [Division of Water Resources](http://water.state.co.us/groundwater/Pages/default.aspx). This tool, from [Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS)](https://www.colorado.gov/cdss) shows that there are over 13,000 wells in the South Platte Basin alone. (Click on the Map tab to see locations in the Basin). Wells are numerous because they allow easy access to water. Wells are often drilled in locations that are convenient to farms and homes, whereas surface water may be located much farther away.

Small wells, such as domestic wells, are constructed after obtaining a well permit and have limited size (50 gallons per minute or less). Larger wells, such as used for agriculture and municipal supply, have a water right decree and typically have a Water District Identifier (WDID) similar to headgates, with similar [diversion record data](https://dnrweb.state.co.us/cdss/Structures?submitButton=Submit&SelectedGeoValue=waterDivisionDiv&SelectedWaterDivisionId=1&SelectedStructureId=2) as headgate diversions. [Water level data](https://dnrweb.state.co.us/cdss/GroundWater/WaterLevels?submitButton=Submit&SelectedGeoValue=waterDivisionDiv&SelectedWaterDivisionId=1&SelectedPublicationAreaName=All&SelectedAquiferName=All) for wells is also important because it relates to the depth of wells needed to access the water, and in some areas, high water tables have resulted in flooding fields and infrastructure (see [HB1278 Study: Groundwater Modeling Efforts](http://water.state.co.us/DivisionsOffices/Div1SPlatteRiverBasin/Pages/GroundwaterSterling.aspx) for the Gilcrest/LaSalle and Sterling areas. Also see an [update](https://coyotegulch.blog/2018/01/08/gilcrest-high-groundwater-levels-update/) for Gilcrest and a [hydrogeologic characterization report](http://coloradogeologicalsurvey.org/water/groundwater/gilcrest-lasalle-hydrogeologic-characterization-report/) for the area.)
