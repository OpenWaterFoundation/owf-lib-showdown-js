Hydrology Concepts - Water Resources System
===============
In addition to the natural hydrologic system, water resources in Colorado include human-created systems containing the following constructs:

- legal constructs, such as water law
- physical constructs, such as infrastructure that is used to store and convey water
- operational constructs, such as agreements that control how systems are operated to deliver water to paying customers or shareholders

Surface water use in Colorado is administered by the [Division of Water Resources (DWR)](http://water.state.co.us/Home/Pages/default.aspx). DWR is tasked with providing the dependable distribution of water in accordance with statutes, decrees and interstate compacts. DWR relies on real-time and other data from its own streamgages, as well as data from federal agencies such as [U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/rt), [Bureau of Reclamation](https://water.usbr.gov/), [Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)](https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/wsf/index.html) and local entities such as cities and water districts.

A diagram representation of a water system can represent the complexities of the system in a more readable format, although the information is complex. The complexity of water resources systems is illustrated by “straight line diagrams” that combine physical and legal information to help people understand water resources systems. The diagrams are graphical linear representations of structures and water rights for a given stream system that allows a large amount of complex information to be observed at a glance. This straight line diagram of water district 04 (Big Thompson River) can also be viewed and zoomed into [here](https://dnrweblink.state.co.us/dwr/DocView.aspx?dbid=0&id=2083919&page=1&searchid=fd2f4d5d-003a-48dc-bb41-b937f8afa88f&cr=1). Straight line diagrams for other basins are also available.
